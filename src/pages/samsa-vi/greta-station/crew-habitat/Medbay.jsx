        An exciting discovery was made with the recent capture of a live "Carcinid"! We've speculated for months how these "carcs" reproduce. These creature with contain no reproductive organs in their bodies, so the autopsies proved futile in this endeavor. The team led by Dr. Edem (myself) has discovered that these creatures use a kind of shriek in order to replicate. I have named this shriek a "krebslieder." More study must be made to discover how this shriek works.

        <em>Note: I should mention that much of the data collection for this discovery was made by Science Officer Hinton. However, it required someone with my level of expertise to analyze that data and find its true meaning.</em>
